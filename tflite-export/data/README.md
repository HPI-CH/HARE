# Data directory
To execute code in [tflite-export](../../tflite-export/) you need to acquire some data sets.

1. download the data sets `opportunity`, `gait` and `nursing` [here](https://nextcloud.hpi.de/s/fSKsgwQ2bx2DRWs). 
2. unpack the zip archives to [this directory](.) so that the directories `tflite-export/data/nursing`, `tflite-export/data/opportunity` and `tflite-export/data/gait` exist.
