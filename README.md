SensOr-based Nursing Activity Recognition

As the study is composed of different building blocks, it contains different folders for each task. The code is structured as follows:
- **ml-pipeline**
```
Code to reproduce the experiments for a single modality (IMU data)
```
- **multimodal**
```
Code to reproduce the experiments from the two data sources IMU & Pose Estimations
```
- **tflite-export**
```
Code to reproduce the on-device experiments
```
- **xsens_android**
```
Android code for real-time human activity recognition using the Xsens DOT sensors
